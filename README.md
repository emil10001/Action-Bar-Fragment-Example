This project was hacked together from various examples of fragments that I've found laying around the web. I needed something that I could reference and extend easily, using a straightforward framework. I think that I've delivered that here. If you've read up on Fragments, what's going on here should make some sense. I also wanted to use fragments that I didn't see in examples, so one is a webview - which does appear in [CommonsWare's](http://commonsware.com/) (commonsguy) [example](https://github.com/commonsguy/cw-android/tree/master/Fragments/EU4You_6), though mine is a bit different, and a grid view extending Fragment, which I have not seen at all. I also am setting the size of the images in the gridview programatically, which took me some digging to figure out how to do, finally found it on google's android blog.

Requires ActionBarSherlock (v3.5.1) library to provide an action bar to any android 2.1 and up. Get library [here](http://actionbarsherlock.com)
